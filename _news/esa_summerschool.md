I just returned from Belgium, as I joined the summer program on Gravity-Related Research organized by the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/).
I was very pleased to be among one of the few selected, and could not be more satisfied with the experience.
Do monitor upcoming programs organized by ESA, they have some super interesting events coming soon!
