As part of my work at [Reef Support](https://www.reef.support), I got interviewed by the European Space Agency's [Space Business Innovation Centre](https://www.sbicnoordwijk.nl), joined by my CEO and CTO. We discussed some of the details of a GIS tool I developed to aid policy-makers, locals and researchers in monitoring critical developments of coral reefs in areas of interest.
