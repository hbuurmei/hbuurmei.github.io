Earlier this month, I had the privilege of delivering a presentation at the [Schemerlicht Festival](https://schemerlichtfestival.nl), alongside one of my colleagues from [Reef Support](https://www.reef.support/).
It was an honor to share the stage with distinguished guests, including one of the co-founders of [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/), whose focus is on innovative sustainability solutions.

During my talk, I had the opportunity to articulate my vision regarding how we can harness the capabilities of satellites to enrich our understanding of Earth. I emphasized the potential of satellite data in predicting coral bleaching, shedding light on the invaluable tools we are developing at Reef Support to achieve this and other related objectives.

To immerse yourself in the vibrant atmosphere of the event, I invite you to watch the [aftermovie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATyY01uu_-c).
It was an inspiring experience!
