I graduated in [Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae) with Summa Cum Laude!
I am immensely grateful for all the opportunities that were provided to me in my incredible three years here, I could have simply not learned more in during my time here!
Super excited to share that next, I will be joining the [Aeronautics and Astronautics department at Stanford University](https://aa.stanford.edu/).
I cannot wait for my adventure to the US!
