I am tremendously honored to have received the André Kuipers Aerospace Award 2022 alongside my exceptional team. This award represents the culmination of our collective dedication to designing a system that actively promotes space sustainability—which is aptly summarized by our slogan as *making space in space*.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my remarkable team members, invaluable mentors, and the Dutch Aerospace Fund for their support and guidance throughout this journey. Your contributions were instrumental in making this achievement possible. Together, we've taken a significant step toward a more sustainable future in space exploration.
