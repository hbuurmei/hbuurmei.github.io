Hi there! I am Hugo and I am a current master's student at Stanford University interested in robotics and controls. I am excited about doing research and will be continuing my academic career by pursuing a PhD.

**Current research interests:**
- Performance guarantees for learned modules of autonomy stack
- Autonomy for (distributed) space missions
- Bio-inspired and soft robotics
