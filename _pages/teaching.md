Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of being a teaching assistant, working closely with professors to enhance the learning experiences of students. Here are some of the courses I've been involved with:

| Course                                                     | University     | Description   |
| :-----------                                               | :------------  | :------------ |
| *AE2135-II Engineering Vibrations*                         | TU Delft       | Students learn how to model practical engineering problems using approximate models, and analyze the vibrational properties. |
| *EE156-256 Board Level Design*                             | Stanford       | Learn how to rapidly create board level electronics, where students will bring up several PCBs and do a final project leveraging their just acquired skills. |
| *EE292H Engineering, Entrepreneurship and Climate Change*  | Stanford       | Solving climate problems through engineering and entrepreneurship. Mostly a seminar series, with a lot of discussion and student interaction. |
| *AA136A Spacecraft Design I*                               | Stanford       | First part of undergraduate spacecraft capstone course. Students learn all the fundementals to build a spacecraft, specifically a small satellite.  |
| *AA136B Spacecraft Design II*                              | Stanford       | Second part of undergraduate spacecraft capstone course. Final projects include an actual cubesat, with a focus on the ADCS. |
